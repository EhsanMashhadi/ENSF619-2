### Teaching Machines to paint, write, compose and play
The official code repository for examples in the O'Reilly book 'Generative Deep Learning'

https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781492041931/

This repository represents chapter 3 of the book with a concept explanation.

## Structure
This repository is structured as follows:
The `data` folder is where to download relevant data sources (chapter 3 onwards)
The `run` folder stores output from the generative models (chapter 3 onwards)
The `utils` folder stores useful functions that are sourced by the main notebooks

## Getting started
To run the project
1.Clone the repository
2.Create new virtual environment called generative
If you are using Anaconda, you can set up a virtual environment as follows:
conda create -n generative python=3.6 ipykernel
3.To install all the requirements use the command below:
